Bits and Bytes: How can we use how a computer represents data to our advantage?
===============================================================================

Learning Goals
---------------------------

* Gain a deeper understanding about how a computer represents data with binary
  * Understand the differences between the representation in primitive types (int vs long, float vs double)
* Understand the implications of finite bit representation
  * Obtain familarity with bitwise operators
  * Understand how to exploit byte representation to lead to memory efficient solutions to problems
  * Understand best practices for avoiding common problems such as integer overflow and floating point rounding error

Pre-work: Essential Reading:
---------------------------

Ada Textbook-Curriculum: [Introduction to Binary & Memory](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/textbook-curriculum/blob/e39e0cffbc7d315ecd326d1a913823512ca44cc2/04-cs-fundamentals/classroom/Binary.md)

Specifically the first section:

* Understanding binary
  * Convert from binary to decimal
  * Convert from decimal to binary

We'll cover the rest about memory as well in more depth in another booster pack.

Agenda:
---------------------------

In this pack, we'll be trying to gain a deeper understanding of how we as software engineers can use binary to our advantage
when trying to build memory efficient systems.

We'll also be exploring the common pitfalls that have created serious bugs causing million of dollars in damage to systems all over the world.

Let's begin! For this pack, start out with card 0, `card-0-basic-bit-manipulation` and then feel free to proceed through the rest of the cards whichever way you like.
